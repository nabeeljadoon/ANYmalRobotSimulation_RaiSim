This is the deep reinforcement learning implementation on ANYmal Robot

To Train the Policy Runner.py is used.

To Test the Policy Test.py --weight <directory> filename.pt is used.


Please note that the simulation software used for this project is RaiSim, provides superior performance than MujuCO etc in some case. For Benchmarking see the following link.https://leggedrobotics.github.io/SimBenchmark/
